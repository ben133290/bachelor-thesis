\section{Sliding Tile Puzzle} \label{section:slidingtile}

The classic sliding tile puzzle (or 15-puzzle) is a two dimensional combination puzzle composed of 15 numbered tiles and one empty tile arranged in a 
four by four square. The position of the empty tile can be swapped with adjacent tiles. The goal of the puzzle is to reach a state where the 
numbered tiles are in row-wise ascending order starting from the top left and the empty tile is at a specified position (typically the top left).
